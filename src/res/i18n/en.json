    "content": "<div class='container container--align-left'><p class='smaller'>Last update: 21 December 2020.</p> <h3 class='legal'>How Immuni works in six steps</h3> <p><strong>The app assigns a random code to each device</strong></p> <p class='smaller'> The code is randomly generated and does not contain any information that identifies users and their device. In addition, the code assigned to each device changes several times per hour to better protect the users’ privacy. </p> <p> <strong >Those devices that meet exchange their respective random codes</strong > </p> <p class='smaller'> When a user comes into contact with another Immuni user, the devices exchange their codes via Bluetooth Low Energy. The app thus keeps track of the contact made without knowing the identity of the users or where they met. </p> <p> <strong >Those who test positive choose whether to share their random codes</strong > </p> <p class='smaller'> Users who have tested positive for the virus, with the support of a healthcare professional, may upload to a server the random codes that their devices have transmitted during the previous days. By uploading them to the server, the codes are made available to all the devices that have the app installed, without allowing the direct identification of positive users. </p> <p> <strong >Each device checks if it has previously seen one or more of the shared codes</strong > </p> <p class='smaller'> Immuni periodically checks the codes on the server and compares them with those saved on the users’ device. This determines whether a user has been exposed to a potential infection. </p> <p><strong>If a match is found, the user is alerted</strong></p> <p class='smaller'> If Immuni detects that the device on which it is installed came into close contact with the device of a person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), it notifies the user and tells him/her what to do. Immuni operates based on simple proximity detection and does not take into account any individual protection measures that users might have taken. </p> <p><strong>Immuni exchanges codes with other European countries</strong></p> <p class='smaller'> Immuni dialogues with similar APPs from other EU countries through an interoperability procedure that allows the exchange of tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 user codes. In case of travel to one or more EU countries, the user of the Immuni APP may indicate the country or countries of interest, i.e. which he will travel to, using a specific function of the APP. <br> <br> The interoperability procedure, also using the selection of the Countries of Interest made by the user, allows Immuni to alert its users in the event of a possible risk contact with a tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 user of similar European APP and, vice versa, similar European APPs to alert their users of a possible risk contact with tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 users of Immuni. </p> <p class='smaller'> Immuni can do all of the above without collecting information about the movements of users or the people they meet. </p> <h3 class='legal'>1. Data Controller</h3> <p class='smaller'> The Italian Ministry of Health, in its capacity as Data Controller (the “Controller”) of personal data collected within the COVID-19 alert system, consisting of a single national platform for the management of alerts to persons who voluntarily installed the Immuni application (“Immuni” or the “App”), informs the users as follows. </p> <h3 class='legal'>2. Purposes of the Processing</h3> <p class='smaller'> Personal data will be used for the purpose of alerting users who came into a risk contact with other users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and of protecting their health through the prevention measures provided for within the public health actions related to the COVID-19 emergency, as provided for in Article 6 of Decree-Law No. 28 of 30 April 2020. Furthermore, the data may be used, in aggregate and anonymous form, for public health, prophylaxis, statistical or scientific research purposes only. </p> <h3 class='legal'>3. Legal Basis</h3> <p class='smaller'> The data are processed in accordance with Article 6 of Decree-Law No. 28 of 30 April 2020, in compliance with Article 6, paragraph 1, letter e) and Article 9, paragraph 2, letters i) and j) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-sexies of the Italian Personal Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree No. 196/2003, as subsequently amended and supplemented). </p> <h3 class='legal'>4. Type of Data</h3> <p class='smaller'> By default, the personal data that the App collects do not allow the direct identification of users or of their device. Only the data necessary to alert the users that they have been exposed to a risk of infection, as well as to enable the adoption of any prevention and healthcare measures, are collected. Under no circumstances will the users’ movements be tracked, thus excluding any form of geolocation. </p> <p class='smaller'> Under the COVID-19 alert system, the following data will be processed with reference to the different categories of data subjects. </p> <p class='smaller'> For all App users, the following data will be processed for the purposes specified below: </p> <p style='text-align: center; margin: 24px auto 16px;'><b>List A</b></p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> province of domicile.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the province indicated by the user during the App configuration. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the province of domicile allows the Italian Ministry of Health to monitor the development of the epidemic. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Data</b>: indicators of the App&rsquo;s correct operation. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: indicators that reveal whether the App is working properly (e.g., whether Bluetooth is active). </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the indicators allow identifying and fixing any defects in the App&rsquo;s operation that would prevent users from being alerted in the event of a risk of infection. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data</b>: temporary tokens.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: a temporary code randomly generated by the users&rsquo; devices. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: temporary tokens allow the App to validate the indicators of its correct operation and other statistical data sent by the App. </p> <p class='smaller'><b>Retention</b>: up to 2 months.</p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data</b>: IP address.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the public IP address used by the provider to open a communication from the device to connect to the Internet. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the IP address is necessary to allow the devices to interact with the App server. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: data not stored within the COVID-19 alert system. </p> <p class='smaller'> In addition to the data listed above and collected for all App users, the data indicated below will be processed only for those users exposed to the risk of infection for the purposes specified below: </p> <p style='text-align: center; margin: 24px auto 16px;'><b>List B</b></p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> receipt of exposure notification.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the fact that the user has been alerted as to a previous risk contact. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: this data allows estimating how many users the App has alerted of a potential risk of infection, without being able to trace their identity, and allows the Italian National Health Service to prepare the necessary actions and resources to take care of those users who have received the notification. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data</b>: date of last risk contact.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the day when the last risk contact occurred. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: this data makes it possible to estimate when any symptoms could occur and, therefore, allows the Italian National Health Service to prepare the necessary actions and resources to take care of those users who have been alerted as to the risk of infection. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'> In addition to the data collected for all App users under List A, the data indicated below will be processed only for users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the purposes specified below: </p> <p style='text-align: center; margin: 24px auto 16px;'><b>List C</b></p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> Temporary Exposure Key (TEK).</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the temporary exposure keys through which the user&rsquo;s device has generated the random codes (Rolling Proximity Identifier - RPI) that have been sent, up to a maximum of 14 days before, to the devices with which the user has come into contact. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: it allows to notify of the risk of infection those users who, in the previous days, have come into contact with the user who tested positive, without the App being able to trace their identity or the place where the contact occurred. </p> <p class='smaller'><b>Retention</b>: 14 days.</p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> previous contact risk indicators.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: indicators that allow estimating the level of risk of the contact with another user who tested positive for the virus (e.g., duration of the contact). </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: these indicators allow the Italian Ministry of Health to enhance the accuracy of the model through which the App establishes whether a contact is sufficiently at risk as to trigger a notification. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> Countries of Interest.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: Acronyms of the countries to which the user has declared to go, related to the TEK exposure keys loaded on the backend. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: It allows users of similar interoperable European APPs to be notified of the risk of infection that have come into contact in the previous days with the tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 Immuni user, without the App being able to trace their identity, or the place where the contact occurred. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: 14 days. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'><b>Data:</b> OTP code.</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: a 10-digit unlock code generated by the App. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the code is communicated by the user who tested positive to the healthcare professional who will use it to allow the user to voluntarily upload exposure keys and risk indicators. </p> <p class='smaller'><b>Retention</b>: up to 2 minutes and 30 seconds.</p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Data:</b> date when the symptoms first appeared or date of the swab test. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the day on which the user developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or, in the event of an asymptomatic user, the date when the swab test was made. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the date is communicated to the healthcare professional together with the OTP code. In order to minimise false alarms, the App will only alert those users who have come into contact with the positive user close to the date when the symptoms appeared, or the swab test was made. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: until the need for health protection and prevention related to the spread of covid-19, including cross-border, has ceased, but no later than 31 December 2021. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Data:</b> Unique national code (CUN). </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: the code generated by the “Tessera Sanitaria” (TS) System, which uniquely identifies at national level the results of the tests for the detection of positivity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: the CUN must be communicated to the telephone operator of the call center of Immuni that will use it to verify the positivity of the user through the TS system. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: 14 days. </p> <p class='smaller'>&nbsp;</p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Data:</b> The last 8 digits of the Health Card number. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Definition</b>: Identification number of the health card of the user who intends to load the exposure keys with the collaboration of the telephone operator of the call center of Immuni. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Purpose</b>: It should be communicated, together with the CUN, to the telephone operator of the call center of Immuni who will use it to verify the positivity of the user through the TS system. </p> <p class='smaller'> <b>Retention</b>: data not stored within the COVID-19 alert system. </p> <h3 class='legal'>5. Data Transmission and Flow</h3> <p class='smaller'> For the purposes described in paragraph 2, the data referred to in paragraph 4 are processed as follows. </p> <p class='smaller'> Every 10 minutes, Immuni generates a random code (Rolling Proximity Identifier - RPI) from the daily exposure key (Temporary Exposure Key - TEK) and sends it to those nearby devices that can be reached via Bluetooth Low Energy, triggering an exchange of random codes between the devices (see list A in paragraph 4). </p> <p class='smaller'> When someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the Prevention Department of the competent Local Health Authority shall contact the person who tested positive to collect the necessary information and verify whether they have installed Immuni on their device. If so, the healthcare professional will ask him/her to access the App and use the OTP code generation function. The user will then communicate the 10-digit OTP code to the healthcare professional, who will access the Italian Ministry of Health system with the credentials in his/her possession and enter the OTP code and the date when the symptoms appeared or, if the user is asymptomatic, the date the swab test was made. </p> <p class='smaller'> Only if the user confirms on the App the intention to send them, will the exposure keys be sent to the App server. After verifying that the OTP code is correct, the server will make them available to all those devices that have Immuni installed (see list C in paragraph 4). </p> <p class='smaller'> Another option for the user to send his/her exposure keys to the App server, calling the Immuni call center and communicating to the telephone operator the last 8 digits of his health card and the CUN associated with the positive test result. The operator, after verifying the user’s positiveness, will guide him/her in the procedure of sending the exposure keys as described above. </p> <p class='smaller'> Completed the procedure for sending the exposure keys, the CUN associated with the positive test result will be disabled in order to avoid the reuse. </p> <p class='smaller'> During its normal operation, the App periodically downloads from the server the exposure keys shared voluntarily by positive users, to compare them with the random codes registered in the previous days as a result of contacts with other users. </p> <p class='smaller'> If a match is found, the App runs an algorithm on the device that, based on the duration and estimated distance of the contact and on the criteria established by the Italian Ministry of Health, establishes whether to display a notification on the device of the user exposed to the risk of infection, alerting him/her of the contact, communicating the date of the contact and inviting him/her to consult his/her general practitioner or paediatrician. The notification also includes a warning for users aged between 14 and 18 years old to show the notification itself to their parents. </p> <p class='smaller'> In case the user has indicated one or more Countries of Interest, in addition to the national keys, also receives all the keys of other positive users of the selected country or countries or of other nationalities but who have chosen in the same period the same Country of Interest and with which he may have come into close contact. </p> <p class='smaller'> To this end, all the countries that have joined the European interoperability exchange daily the TEKs loaded into their respective backends. </p> <p class='smaller'> In addition to alerting the user exposed to the risk of infection, the App informs the platform of the contact, the date of the contact and the province indicated by the user, in ways that do not allow the direct identification of the user. These data are transmitted for public health, statistical and scientific research purposes (see list B in paragraph 4). </p> <p class='smaller'> On a monthly basis, the following information is sent to the server: statistical data relating to the App’s operation, information on whether the user has received an exposure notification and the province of domicile (see again list A in paragraph 4). These data do not allow any direct identification of users and are necessary to ensure the correct operation of Immuni. </p> <h3 class='legal'>6. Data Retention</h3> <p class='smaller'> The data will be stored for the period specified in paragraph 4 and in any case no later than 31 December 2021. By the same date, all personal data processed will be erased or stored in anonymous and aggregate form. </p> <h3 class='legal'>7. Persons in Charge of Processing</h3> <p class='smaller'> The data may only be accessed by authorised persons duly instructed, including with regard to compliance with security measures and confidentiality obligations. </p> <p class='smaller'> The Controller may avail itself of persons authorised to process the abovementioned data, who will process the data as Data Processors pursuant to Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. </p> <h3 class='legal'>8. Data Subjects’ Rights</h3> <p class='smaller'> At any time, data subjects may exercise the right to object under Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and stop the processing by simply uninstalling the App. The exposure keys will also be gradually erased, at the end of the fourteenth day, on the central infrastructure. Users who intend to object only temporarily to the processing of data may use the function that allows them to temporarily disable the service. Users may at any time delete all exposure keys and random codes stored on their device using the function provided by the manufacturers of iOS and Android operating systems while keeping the App installed. </p> <p class='smaller'> Since identifying data subjects is impossible, Articles 15 to 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, relating to the exercise of data subjects’ rights, shall not apply, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 2 of the said Regulation. </p> <p class='smaller'> Data subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Italian Supervisory Authority [Garante per la protezione dei dati personali], pursuant to Article 77 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Alternatively, they may lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority of the European Union State where they reside or habitually work, or in the place where the alleged breach occurred. </p> <p class='smaller'> Data subjects may exercise their rights by sending a written request by post to “Ministero della Salute - direzione generale della digitalizzazione, del sistema informativo sanitario e della statistica - viale Giorgio Ribotta no. 5 - 00144, Rome”, to the e-mail address direzionesistemainformativo@sanita.it or to the certified e-mail address DGSI@postacert.sanita.it. Data subjects may contact the Data Protection Officer (DPO) at rpd@sanita.it. </p></div>"
