    "content": "<div class='container container--align-left'><p class='smaller'>Last update: December 30th, 2022.</p><p class='smaller'>The IMMUNI APP is terminated on December 31st, 2022. Since the same date, all processing of personal data carried out by the Ministry of Health will be stopped and all personal data processed will be erased or permanently rendered anonymous, as provided for in Article 6 of Decree-Law No. 28, 30 April 2020, converted with amendments by Law No. 70 of 25 June 2020. Below is all the information on the functioning of the Immuni App and the personal data processed during the period of the activity of the App.</p><h3 class='legal'>How Immuni works in seven steps</h3><p><strong>The app assigns a random code to each device</strong></p><p class='smaller'> The code is randomly generated and does not contain any information that identifies users and their device. In addition, the code assigned to each device changes several times per hour to better protect the users’ privacy.</p><p> <strong>Those devices that meet exchange their respective random codes</strong></p><p class='smaller'> When a user comes into contact with another Immuni user, the devices exchange their codes via Bluetooth Low Energy. The app thus keeps track of the contact made without knowing the identity of the users or where they met.</p><p> <strong>Those who test positive choose whether to share their random codes</strong></p><p class='smaller'> Users who have tested positive for the virus may upload to a server - with the support of a healthcare professional of the Local Health Unit - the random codes that their devices have transmitted to other devices during the previous days. Alternatively, users may upload the random codes autonomously through the specific function in the app. By uploading them to the server, the codes are made available to all the devices that have already installed the app, without allowing the direct identification of positive users.</p><p> <strong>Each device checks if it has previously seen one or more of the shared codes</strong></p><p class='smaller'> Immuni periodically checks the codes on the server and compares them with those saved on the users’ device. This determines whether a user has been exposed to a potential infection.</p><p><strong>If a match is found, the user is alerted</strong></p><p class='smaller'> If Immuni detects that the device on which it is installed came into close contact with the device of a person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), it notifies the user and tells him/her what to do. Immuni operates based on simple proximity detection and does not take into account any individual protection measures that users might have taken.</p><p><strong>Immuni exchanges codes with other European countries</strong></p><p class='smaller'> Immuni dialogues with similar APPs from other EU countries through an interoperability procedure that allows the exchange of tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 user codes. In case of travel to one or more EU countries, the user of the Immuni App may indicate the country or countries of interest, i.e. which he will travel to, using a specific function of the App. <br> <br> The interoperability procedure, also using the selection of the Countries of Interest made by the user, allows Immuni to alert its users in the event of a possible risk contact with a tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 user of similar European App and, vice versa, similar European Apps to alert their users of a possible risk contact with tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 users of Immuni.</p><p class='smaller'> Immuni can do all of the above without collecting information about the movements of users or the people they meet.</p><p> <strong>Immuni allows you to acquire your Covid-19 green certificate</strong></p><p class='smaller'> Since the activation of the National Platform-DGC (PN-DGC), the Immuni App has also become one of the possible channels for acquiring the Covid-19 green certificates issued by the platform itself. The user can retrieve their Certificate by entering the expiration date and the last 8 digits of their Health Card in the Immuni App and one of the codes (AUTHCODE, CUN, NRFE, NUCG) they received through the email or SMS contacts they provided when either they were administered a vaccine, or they received a negative outcome of a molecular/antigenic swab test performed at the authorized facilities, or when they were provided with a certificate of recovery from Covid-19. The App allows the user to save the certificate on their device to be able to show in case of verification and remove it at any time.</p><h3 class='legal'>1. Data Controller</h3><p class='smaller'> The Italian Ministry of Health, in its capacity as Data Controller (the “Controller”) of personal data collected within the COVID-19 alert system, consisting of a single national platform for the management of alerts to persons who voluntarily installed the Immuni application (“Immuni” or the “App”), informs the users as follows.</p><h3 class='legal'>2. Purposes of the Processing</h3><p class='smaller'> Personal data will be used for the purpose of alerting users who came into a risk contact with other users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and of protecting their health through the prevention measures provided for within the public health actions related to the COVID-19 emergency, as provided for in Article 6 of Decree-Law No. 28 of 30 April 2020. This is also within the European Union through interoperability with similar national APPs. Furthermore, the data may be used, in aggregate and anonymous form, for public health, prophylaxis, statistical or scientific research purposes only.</p><p class='smaller'> Additional personal data is also processed in the event the user chooses to use the App to acquire Covid-19 green certificates.</p><h3 class='legal'>3. Legal Basis</h3><p class='smaller'> The data are processed in accordance with Article 6 of Decree-Law of 30 April 2020, n. 28, as amended by Article 2 of Decree-Law of 7 October 2020, n. 125, as well as with Article 20 of Decree-Law of 28 October 2020, n. 137, in compliance with Articles 6, paragraph 1, letter e) and Article 9, paragraph 2, letters i) and j) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-sexies of the Italian Personal Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree No. 196/2003, as subsequently amended and supplemented). The possibility of autonomous acquisition of Covid-19 green certificates by interested parties through the functions of the Immuni App is sanctioned by Article 42 of the Decree-Law of 31 May 2021, n. 77.</p><h3 class='legal'>4. Type of Data</h3><p class='smaller'> By default, the personal data that the App collects do not allow the direct identification of users or of their device. Only the data necessary to alert the users that they have been exposed to a risk of infection, as well as to enable the adoption of any prevention and healthcare measures, are collected. Under no circumstances will the users’ movements be tracked, thus excluding any form of geolocation.</p><p class='smaller'> Under the COVID-19 alert system, the following data will be processed with reference to the different categories of data subjects.</p><p class='smaller'> For all App users, the following data will be processed for the purposes specified below:</p><p style='text-align: center;

If so, the healthcare professional will ask him/her to access the App and use the OTP code generation function. The user will then communicate the 10-digit OTP code to the healthcare professional, who will access the Italian Ministry of Health system with the credentials in his/her possession and enter the OTP code and the date of the day when the symptoms appeared or, if the user is asymptomatic, the day the swab test was taken.</p><p class='smaller'> Only if the user confirms on the App the intention to send them, will the exposure keys be sent to the App server. After verifying that the OTP code is correct, the server will make them available to all those devices that have Immuni installed (see list C in paragraph 4).</p><p class='smaller'> Another option for the user is to send autonomously his/her own exposition keys to the server by using the App’s functions which allow to upload the CUN with the test results, along with the last eight digits of the TS Card number and - if the user is symptomatic - the date of the day when the symptoms started. This data will be transferred by the App to the backend system which will verify through the TS system the existence of an actual positive test. In the case of confirmation of a positive test, the system will allow the App to upload the exposition keys. If the user is asymptomatic, the day of the swab test will be traced automatically by the TS system through the CUN.</p><p class='smaller'> Completed the procedure for sending the exposure keys, the CUN associated with the positive test result will be disabled in order to avoid the reuse. After 14 days from the day when the swab test was taken, the CUN will be disabled.</p><p class='smaller'> During its normal operation, the App periodically downloads from the server the exposure keys shared voluntarily by positive users, even of similar European interoperable Apps if the same users have been in Italy in the last 14 days, to compare them with the random codes registered in the previous days as a result of contacts with other users.</p><p class='smaller'> If a match is found, the App runs an algorithm on the device that, based on the duration and estimated distance of the contact and on the criteria established by the Italian Ministry of Health, establishes whether to display a notification on the device of the user exposed to the risk of infection, alerting him/her of the contact, communicating the date of the contact day and inviting him/her to consult his/her general practitioner or pediatrician. The notification also includes a warning for users aged between 14 and 18 years old to show the notification itself to their parents.</p><p class='smaller'> In case the user has indicated one or more Countries of Interest, in addition to the national keys, also receives all the keys of other positive users of the selected country or countries or of other nationalities but who have chosen in the same period the same Country of Interest and with which he may have come into close contact.</p><p class='smaller'> To this end, all the countries that have joined the European interoperability exchange daily the TEKs loaded into their respective backends.</p><p class='smaller'> In addition to alerting the user exposed to the risk of infection, the App informs the platform of the contact, the contact day and the province indicated by the user, in ways that do not allow the direct identification of the user. These data are transmitted for public health, statistical and scientific research purposes (see list B in paragraph 4).</p><p class='smaller'> On a monthly basis, the following information is sent to the server: statistical data relating to the App’s operation, information on whether the user has received an exposure notification and the province of domicile (see again list A in paragraph 4). These data do not allow any direct identification of users and are necessary to ensure the correct operation of Immuni.</p><p class='smaller'> In addition to the data flows listed above, in the event that the user decides to use the App for the acquisition of the Covid-19 green certificate, the App contacts the Immuni server by sending the last 8 digits, the expiration date of the health card and the unique code provided by the user. These data is subjected to the control of the Health Card System to verify the existence of a suitable condition for the issue of a Covid-19 green certificate by the National Platform-DGC. If successful, the user's device receives the QR Code via a dedicated connection, containing the data of the Certificate itself.</p><h3 class='legal'>6. Data Retention</h3><p class='smaller'> The data will be stored for the period specified in paragraph 4 and in any case no later than 31 December 2022. By the same date, all personal data processed will be erased or stored in anonymous and aggregate form.</p><h3 class='legal'>7. Persons in Charge of Processing</h3><p class='smaller'> The data may only be accessed by authorised persons duly instructed, including with regard to compliance with security measures and confidentiality obligations.</p><p class='smaller'> The Controller may avail itself of persons authorised to process the abovementioned data, who will process the data as Data Processors pursuant to Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><h3 class='legal'>8. Data Subjects’ Rights</h3><p class='smaller'> At any time, data subjects may exercise the right to object under Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and stop the processing by simply uninstalling the App. The exposure keys will also be gradually erased, at the end of the fourteenth day, on the central infrastructure. Users who intend to object only temporarily to the processing of data may use the function that allows them to temporarily disable the service. Users may at any time delete all exposure keys and random codes stored on their device using the function provided by the manufacturers of iOS and Android operating systems while keeping the App installed.</p><p class='smaller'> Since identifying data subjects is impossible, Articles 15 to 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, relating to the exercise of data subjects’ rights, shall not apply, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 2 of the said Regulation.</p><p class='smaller'> If the QR Code relating to a Covid-19 green certificate has been stored in the device, the user has can (with a function) remove all the information relating to the certificate from the device itself at any time and independently.</p><p class='smaller'> Specific information on Covid-19 green certificates is available on the website of the National Platform-DGC (www.dgc.gov.it) where the relative privacy information is also available.</p><p class='smaller'> Data subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Italian Supervisory Authority [Garante per la protezione dei dati personali], pursuant to Article 77 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Alternatively, they may lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority of the European Union State where they reside or habitually work, or in the place where the alleged breach occurred.</p><p class='smaller'> Data subjects may exercise their rights by sending a written request by post to “Ministero della Salute - Direzione generale della digitalizzazione, del sistema informativo sanitario e della statistica - Viale Giorgio Ribotta no. 5 - 00144, Rome”, to the e-mail address direzionesistemainformativo@sanita.it or to the certified e-mail address DGSI@postacert.sanita.it.
