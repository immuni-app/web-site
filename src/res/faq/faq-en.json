      "title": "What is Immuni?",
      "content": "Immuni is an app that helps us fight epidemics—starting with COVID-19:\n• The app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic.\n• These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others. This minimises the spread of the virus, while speeding up a return to normal life for most people.\n• By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences."

      "title": "How does Immuni’s exposure notification system work?",
      "content": "Immuni’s exposure notification system aims to alert users when they have been exposed to a potentially infectious user.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and doesn’t use any kind of geolocalisation whatsoever, including GPS data. The app doesn’t (and can’t) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a simplified explanation of how the system works. Let’s consider the example of two hypothetical users, Alice and Marco:\n\nAlice installs the Immuni app. Her smartphone starts sending a Bluetooth Low Energy signal that contains a random code. It does this on a continuous basis. The same goes for Marco. When Alice and Marco are in close proximity, their smartphones mutually store each other’s random code, taking note of that event. Their phones also note how long the event lasted and the approximate distance between the two devices.\n\nThe codes are generated randomly, and they don’t contain any information about the user or their device. They also change several times each hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n\nLet’s suppose that Marco later tests positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thanks to the help of a healthcare operator, Marco is able to transfer some cryptographic keys to a server. From these keys, it is possible to derive Marco’s random codes.\n\nFor each user, the app regularly downloads all the new cryptographic keys sent to the server by those users who tested positive for the virus. The app uses these keys to derive their random codes and checks if any correspond to those stored in the device memory from previous days. As such, Alice’s app will find Marco’s random code, it will check the length and the distance of the contact to evaluate the risk of an infection, and, if necessary, it will notify Alice."

      "title": "How’s my privacy protected?",
      "content": "Throughout the entirety of Immuni’s design and development, we have placed enormous focus on privacy protection. \n\nHere’s a list of some of the measures Immuni uses to protect your data:\n• The app doesn’t collect any data that could lead to it knowing your identity. For example, it doesn’t ask for (and can’t obtain) your name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address.\n• The app doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. Your movements aren’t tracked in any shape or form.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code broadcast by the app is generated completely randomly and doesn’t contain any information about you or your device. This code changes several times each hour, protecting your privacy even more.\n• All Immuni data stored on your smartphone is encrypted.\n• All connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects your data. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers located in Italy and managed by public bodies."

      "title": "Why is Immuni important?",
      "content": "Everybody wants to reduce the spread of the epidemic, minimise the risk to our loved ones, and return to a normal life.\n\nImmuni plays an important role in achieving these goals. Thanks to its exposure notification system, the app makes it possible to quickly alert those who may have been exposed to a potentially infectious user, suggesting actions like self-isolation and calling a general practitioner. Such measures are critical in minimising the number of infections and ensuring that those affected can receive prompt, suitable medical attention—which, in turn, reduces the risk of complications."

      "title": "Is it really necessary that everybody uses the app? What happens if not enough people do so?",
      "content": "Immuni gets increasingly effective as more people use the app. The greater the uptake of Immuni, the higher the number of potentially infected users the app can notify. These users can then self-isolate, helping to contain the epidemic and speeding up the return to a normal life.\n\nHowever, even if the uptake of Immuni ends up being limited, the app will still contribute to slowing down the epidemic—especially in combination with the other measures implemented by the government. Any slowdown would relieve pressure on the National Healthcare Service and help a higher proportion of patients receive proper care—potentially saving many lives. A slowdown would also buy time for the scientific community, as it strives to create a vaccine."

If it’s not, tap on 'Reactivate Immuni' and follow the instructions to make the app work correctly.\n\nSome other important suggestions to ensure that Immuni is effective:\n• When you leave your house, always bring your smartphone with Immuni installed. \n• Don’t disable Bluetooth (except when you’re sleeping, if you prefer).\n• Don’t uninstall the app.\n• When the app sends you a notification, it’s vital that you read it, open the app, and follow all the instructions provided. For example, if the app asks you to upgrade it, please do so. If the app recommends that you self-isolate and call your general practitioner, it’s crucial that you do so right away."

However, without a compatible smartphone, unfortunately, it’s not possible to download and use the app.\n\nImmuni uses the exposure notification technology made available by Apple and Google. This technology determines the system requirements for downloading and using Immuni, and it is not compatible with earlier versions of iOS, Android, and Google Play Services.\n\nThis technology is used by many other countries (for example, Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland). Without it, there would be significant technical limitations—for example, reliably detecting contact between two iPhones would otherwise be impossible. We've elected to develop a system that works effectively on the majority of smartphones, rather than one that works on even more smartphones, but that is much less reliable.\n\nWe know that there are many people who are eager to download and use the app, but whose device is not supported. Unfortunately, at the moment we can’t overcome these limitations.\n\nWe’re aware of how important it is that the highest possible number of people can use Immuni.

      "content": "When two smartphones on which the app is installed are within a few metres of each other, they start exchanging random codes to record that contact took place. However, for you to be notified of a risky exposure, it's not enough that your smartphone has recorded the contact with a user who later tested positive for the virus. The following conditions need to occur:\n• The user who tested positive for the virus must have uploaded their cryptographic keys to Immuni's server to enable the notification of the users to whom they have been exposed\n• As established by the Ministry of Health, the exposure must have taken place for more than 15 minutes at a distance of less than 2 metres\n\nSmartphones cannot measure the distance at which contact takes place directly. Hence, Immuni leverages the attenuation of the Bluetooth Low Energy signal to estimate it. Calibration tests have been carried out to refine this estimate as much as possible. However, the estimate cannot be precise due to a number of disruptive factors. Therefore, the app cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that the distance was actually less than 2 metres.
