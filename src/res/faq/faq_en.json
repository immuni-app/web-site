      "title": "What is Immuni?",
      "content": "<p>Immuni is an app that helps us fight epidemics—starting with COVID-19:</p><ul><li><p>The app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic.</p></li><li><p>These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others. This minimises the spread of the virus, while speeding up a return to normal life for most people.</p></li><li><p>By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.</p></li></ul>"

      "title": "How does Immuni’s exposure notification system work?",
      "content": "<p>Immuni&#39;s exposure notification system aims to alert users when they have been exposed to a potentially infectious user.</p><p>The system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and doesn&#39;t use any kind of geolocalisation whatsoever, including GPS data. The app doesn&#39;t (and can&#39;t) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.</p><p>Here is a simplified explanation of how the system works. Let&#39;s consider the example of two hypothetical users, Alice and Marco:</p><p>Alice installs the Immuni app. Her smartphone starts sending a Bluetooth Low Energy signal that contains a random code. It does this on a continuous basis. The same goes for Marco. When Alice and Marco are in close proximity, their smartphones mutually store each other&#39;s random code, taking note of that event. Their phones also note how long the event lasted and the approximate distance between the two devices.</p><p>The codes are generated randomly, and they don&#39;t contain any information about the user or their device. They also change several times each hour, protecting user privacy even more.</p><p>Let&#39;s suppose that Marco later tests positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thanks to the help of a healthcare operator, Marco is able to transfer some cryptographic keys to a server. From these keys, it is possible to derive Marco&#39;s random codes.</p><p>For each user, the app regularly downloads all the new cryptographic keys sent to the server by those users who tested positive for the virus. The app uses these keys to derive their random codes and checks if any correspond to those stored in the device memory from previous days. As such, Alice&#39;s app will find Marco&#39;s random code, it will check the length and the distance of the contact to evaluate the risk of an infection, and, if necessary, it will notify Alice.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Throughout the entirety of Immuni&#39;s design and development, we have placed enormous focus on privacy protection.</p><p>Here&#39;s a list of some of the measures Immuni uses to protect your data:</p><ul><li><p>The app doesn&#39;t collect any data that could lead to it knowing your identity. For example, it doesn&#39;t ask for (and can&#39;t obtain) your name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address.</p></li><li><p>The app doesn&#39;t collect any geolocalisation data, including GPS data.

      "title": "Why is Immuni important?",
      "content": "<p>Everybody wants to reduce the spread of the epidemic, minimise the risk to our loved ones, and return to a normal life.</p><p>Immuni plays an important role in achieving these goals. Thanks to its exposure notification system, the app makes it possible to quickly alert those who may have been exposed to a potentially infectious user, suggesting actions like self-isolation and calling a general practitioner. Such measures are critical in minimising the number of infections and ensuring that those affected can receive prompt, suitable medical attention—which, in turn, reduces the risk of complications.</p>"

    {
      "title": "Is it really necessary that everybody uses the app? What happens if not enough people do so?",
      "content": "<p>Immuni gets increasingly effective as more people use the app. The greater the uptake of Immuni, the higher the number of potentially infected users the app can notify. These users can then self-isolate, helping to contain the epidemic and speeding up the return to a normal life.</p><p>However, even if the uptake of Immuni ends up being limited, the app will still contribute to slowing down the epidemic—especially in combination with the other measures implemented by the government. Any slowdown would relieve pressure on the National Healthcare Service and help a higher proportion of patients receive proper care—potentially saving many lives. A slowdown would also buy time for the scientific community, as it strives to create a vaccine.</p>"

      "title": "What should I do to make sure I’m using the app correctly?",
      "content": "<p>Failing to use the app correctly makes Immuni much less effective and increases the risk to you, your loved ones, and the community.</p><p>To make sure you are using the app as intended, simply open it and check that &#39;Service active&#39; is written in the Home section. If it&#39;s not, tap on &#39;Reactivate Immuni&#39; and follow the instructions to make the app work correctly.</p><p>Some other important suggestions to ensure that Immuni is effective:</p><ul><li><p>When you leave your house, always bring your smartphone with Immuni installed.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t disable Bluetooth (except when you&#39;re sleeping, if you prefer).</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t uninstall the app.</p></li><li><p>When the app sends you a notification, it&#39;s vital that you read it, open the app, and follow all the instructions provided. For example, if the app asks you to upgrade it, please do so. If the app recommends that you self-isolate and call your general practitioner, it&#39;s crucial that you do so right away.</p></li></ul>"

As such, the app&#39;s assessments won&#39;t always be flawless. If the app recommends that you self-isolate, it doesn&#39;t mean you definitely have SARS-CoV-2. It just means that, based on the information the app has available, isolating yourself is the safest thing to do for yourself and those around you.</p><p>Therefore, it&#39;s crucial that you follow all the instructions provided by the app—for your own good, as well as that of your loved ones and everyone else.
